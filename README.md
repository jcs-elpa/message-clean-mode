# message-clean-mode
> Keep messages buffer clean

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/message-clean-mode/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/message-clean-mode/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Simple minor-mode to keep your `*Messages*` buffer clean, without Emacs spamming
a bunch of command messages.

This is only useful for people who constantly check `*Messages*` buffer for debug log.

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

First, assign commands you want to keep the `*Messages*` buffer clean.

```el
(setq message-clean-mode-mute-commands '(push-mark ...))
(setq message-clean-mode-echo-commands '(set-mark-command ...))
```

Then call `M-x message-clean-mode`!

```el
(setq message-clean-mode-minor-mode 'echo)  ; or `nil' or `mute'
```

This will allow you to mute message like `xxx-minor-mode is enabled/disabled`!
