# message-clean-mode
> Keep messages buffer clean

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/message-clean-mode/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/message-clean-mode/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Simple minor-mode to keep your `*Messages*` buffer clean, without Emacs spamming
a bunch of command messages.

*P.S. This is only useful for people who constantly check `*Messages*` buffer
for debug log.*

## üíæ Quickstart

```el
(leaf message-clean-mode
  :hook (after-init-hook . message-clean-mode)
  :init
  (setq message-clean-mode-mute-commands '(push-mark set-mark-command)
        message-clean-mode-echo-commands '(mwheel-scroll
                                           previous-line next-line
                                           mark-whole-buffer
                                           indent-region
                                           isearch-done
                                           undefined
                                           toggle-truncate-lines)
        message-clean-mode-minor-mode 'echo))  ; echo minor mode only
